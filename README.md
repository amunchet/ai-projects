Random AI Projects that I'm messing about with
  - Deer detector - this was to look through footage from Hunting land to identify deer
  - Intelligent Scale - training a neural net to read the LED numbers on a scale
  - Altamont multi - teaching a neural net to differentiate the different types of Altamont Products
